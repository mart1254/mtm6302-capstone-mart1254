## Report - Mockup

To start off, I drew inspiration from the PokeDex in Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver – this is where I got the overall red, grey, and grid scheme. 

I wanted to keep my navbar very simple and not clutter it too much with tabs/buttons so I decided to simply have a search icon, the logo, and a symbol of a pokeball to indicate caught/favourite pokemon. My plan to make the caught/favourite list more accessible is to add a tooltip when hovered or focused on so users will have a better understanding if they are confused.
The web app will take the user to the home page on startup. Due to the fact that the PokeDex is supposed to display 20 pokemon at a time in a grid format, I opted to have cards with the most important information regarding the pokemon, which would be index/id of pokemon, pixelated image, name, type, and caught toggle.

I wanted the pokedex to resemble the older editions of the game which is why I used the pixelated sprites as the thumbnails. I also added a toggle so users can quickly mark pokemon they have caught with a toggle switch. The toggle switch in question is just a regular one when in the off position but when the user toggles on or “caught” the toggle switch turns into a pokeball to help signify it has been caught. Likewise, when the user toggles a pokeball icon will appear in the top left of the thumbnail to help better distinguish caught pokemon from uncaught pokemon.

If the user wants to see their caught or favourite pokemon, they can click the pokeball at the top left of the navbar to display all their caught pokemon in a grid, ordered from lowest index to highest.
If the user wants to know more information about their caught pokemon – or any pokemon for that matter, they simply click the thumbnail and will be sent to the pokemon’s profile page where they will get the standard information present on the thumbnail, with additional Description information to help give them a better idea about the pokemon. 
For the profile page I decided to use the artwork as I found the artwork to be a better physical representation of the pokemon.

For tablet I decided to use a grid with three columns for better accessibility of pokemon while also being able to use the larger screen real estate and display more on screen. Further, for the profile section I decided to enlarge the pokemon’s profile picture and move it to the side for better overall readability and less scrolling.

For desktop I debated adding more thumbnails by reducing their size but felt it was too difficult to see which pokemon were actually on screen, which is why I went with a five column grid and enlarged thumbnails so users would be able to better see the pokemon they were looking for while scrolling faster. For the profile page I wanted the image to take up a large portion of the screen so users could “study” the physical appearance of these pokemon (if we were in the world of pokemon).

I overall went with rounded edges to better give the pokedex a more modern feel while staying true to the Heart Gold and Soul Silver style of pokedex.

Here are the two reference images I drew inspiration from:
